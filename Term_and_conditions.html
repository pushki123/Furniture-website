        <div class="t1">Refunds</div>
        <div class="t2">Woodcraft strives to make all our customers happy, but given the custom nature of our business, Refunds (which is an event that can only take place after the delivery of an item) are not an option.</div>
        <div class="t1">Order Cancellation</div>
        <div class="t2">Due to the custom nature of our business, we donâ€™t stock inventory and therefore cancelling an order for a full or partial refund is not an option.</div>
        <div class="t1">Reworked Items</div>
        <div class="t2">If Management decides that a piece is brought back for repairs, re-do, re-work, re-staining or re-building, the customer must come in to approve the piece before it is re-delivered.</div>
        <div class="t1">Payment Policy</div>
        <div class="t2">Local Customers (Within 2 hour drive of Markham Head office)</div>
        <div class="t2">Woodcraft accepts cash, Visa and Mastercard, cheque, debit, bank draft, wire transfer, and e-transfer as valid methods of payment.

            Woodcraft customers can pay their 50% deposit on Visa or Mastercard without a servicing fee. The outstanding balance is to be paid prior to delivery or pick up. All the payment options mentioned above are options to settlement. However, should a customer elect to pay by credit card, there will be a 2% service fee applied to the outstanding balance of the order.
            
            Woodcraft reserves the right to alter the payment policy at the discretion of management.

            Payment in full is to be made before we ship out.
            
            At anytime without notice, Woodcraft reserves the right to alter the payment policy at the discretion of management.
            
            Woodcraft is not responsible for import duties or sales taxes imposed on clients orders outside of Ontario. The total cost of such duties and taxes are to paid for by the customer.</div>
        <div class="t1">Local Pick-up and Delivery Policy</div>
        <div class="t2">Clients choosing to pick up their order from Woodcraft are responsible for the handling, safe-transport, and care of furniture including loading and unloading, the packing/wrapping of the product, as well as any necessary assembly or disassembly. Woodcraft assumes no responsibility for any injuries sustained or damage done to a product while being picked up by a client. It is the responsibility of the customer to bring the necessary man-power to load the furniture into their vehicles.</div>
        <div class="t2">If a customer picks up an order(s), it is the responsibility of the customer to thoroughly inspect all the furniture on the order(s) before loading the furniture. When the order leaves Woodcraftâ€™s dock, it is assumed that the piece of furniture was received in good condition.</div>
        <div class="t2">If a customer elects to pick-up an order and subsequently notices an issue with a piece of furniture which requires transportation back to Woodcraft, it is the responsibility of the customer to bring it back in good condition.</div>
        <div class="t2">Woodcraft will provide delivery services for an additional charge. Woodcraft will do its utmost to ensure safe handling and transport of its product but cannot be responsible for damages incurred within a clientâ€™s home. It is not the responsibility of Woodcraft to move any homeowners possessions. All possessions must be moved out of the way before the delivery begins. Any damage caused by Woodcraft will be appropriately rectified at the discretion of Woodcraftâ€™s management.</div>
        <div class="t2">Woodcraft is not responsible if the furniture does not fit inside the house. It is the responsibility of the client to measure in advance and ensure that everything will fit. Woodcraft can provide our advice on weather an item can fit, but it is still the clients responsibility. Woodcraft is to be paid in full even if the furniture does not fit inside the house or room.</div>
        <!-- <div class="t2"></div> -->
        <div class="t1">Long Distant Delivery</div>
        <div class="t2">The customer is responsible for all return shipping costs, entirely. Returns that are damaged, soiled, or altered may not be accepted and sent back to the customer.</div>
        <div class="t2">In the rare event that warranty work is required, the customer is responsible for paying all transportation and packaging charges.</div>
        <div class="t1">Lead Time</div>
        <div class="t2">Anticipated delivery dates are approximations and given in good faith. However, the lead time can change depending on the availability of materials and other factors. Therefore, delivery dates cannot be guaranteed and delays may occur. If an order delivery date falls outside of  the lead times given, this does not result in the cancellation or refund of an order.</div>
        <div class="t2">We will do our best to keep you informed of such delays.</div>
        <div class="t1">Long Term Storage</div>
        <div class="t2">Woodcraft offers storage at managements sole discretion. Should Woodcraft elect to store a clients furniture, below are the terms of our long-term storage agreement: </div>
        <div class="t3">1. Payment of outstanding balance must be settled before entering long-term storage. If clients want to inspect the furniture before storing, accommodations for a convenient time for both parties will be agreed.</div>
        <div class="t3">2. Woodcraft does not have a climate controlled storage facility. Therefore any damage that occurs to furniture pieces as a result of being exposed to a non-climate controlled setting is the sole responsibility of the clients to fix. If Woodcraft elects to do the repair work, the total cost of the repair work will be covered by the client. For greater certainty, there are no refunds or cancellation for damage caused in Long-Term storage. This is a purely a courtesy service we do to go above-and-beyond for our clients.</div>
        <div class="t3">3. If client wants more packaging than Woodcraftâ€™s standard packaging for Long-Term Storage, then an additional cost will be calculate and charged.</div>
        <div class="t1">Pricing</div>
        <div class="t2">A 50% deposit is required in order to secure a current price.</div>
        <div class="t2">If a discrepancy is found between in-store pricing or online pricing and our internal price book, the price listed within Woodcraftâ€™s price book is to be considered final.</div>
        <div class="t1">Sales Price Matching</div>
        <div class="t2">Woodcraft does not offer price matching on items that become available for sale at a later date. The reason why is that we pre-order lumber at discount rates during that time.</div>
